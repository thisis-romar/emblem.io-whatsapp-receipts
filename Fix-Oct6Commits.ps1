.SYNOPSIS
    Fix October 6th commits to have correct AI attribution

.DESCRIPTION
    This script corrects the attribution for October 6th commits that were AI-assisted
    but incorrectly attributed to "thisis-romar". Uses git filter-branch to rewrite
    commit history with proper AI attribution.

.NOTES
    Based on sequential thinking analysis of October 6th AI-assisted commits.
    Preserves the one commit (c4d9495) that already has correct attribution.
